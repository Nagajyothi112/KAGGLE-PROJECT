Cultivated for over 6,000 years, the olive has transcended its role as a mere food source to become a symbol of peace, prosperity, and cultural identity. In the modern world, the olive continues to play a multifaceted role, enriching our diets, fueling economies, and contributing to our well-being in ways both tangible and intangible.\n\n**A Culinary Staple and Global Commodity:**\n\nThe olive's versatility is unmatched. From the delicate bite of green olives to the bold flavor of black olives, these fruits offer a spectrum of taste sensations that complement countless dishes. In Mediterranean cuisine, olives are a cornerstone, adding salty, briny notes to salads, pizzas, and pasta dishes. Beyond the Mediterranean, olives have found their way into global kitchens, their presence gracing everything from gourmet sandwiches\n",

He longed for adventure beyond the confines of his cozy living room.\n\nOne sunny afternoon, a mischievous breeze caught the window screen, flapping it with a rhythmic whoosh. Bartholomew, perched on the windowsill, felt a thrill course through him. This was his chance! With a practiced leap, he sprung onto the window ledge, wriggling through the gap the breeze had created.\n\nThe world outside was a symphony of smells and sounds – exhaust fumes, blooming flowers, the distant rumble of a truck. Bartholomew, exhilarated, set off down the street, his emerald eyes wide with wonder. He scampered through gardens, leaping over fences, weaving through legs of unsuspecting passersby.\n\nHis journey led him to a bustling market, a chaotic blend of colours and smells. A vendor, chuckling at the sight of the tiny adventurer, offered Bartholomew a bite of fresh salmon, which the cat devoured with gusto.\n\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows, Bartholomew found himself in a park. He climbed a tree, its branches reaching up to the star-dusted sky. From his perch, he watched the world below, a tapestry of twinkling lights and hushed conversations.\n\nSuddenly, a small, whimpering sound reached his ears. It was a kitten, trapped in a tangled mess of vines. Bartholomew, instinctively, knew what he had to do. With a nimble leap, he landed on the ground and, with a series of quick bites, freed the kitten. The little creature, overwhelmed with gratitude, rubbed against Bartholomew's leg.\n\nAs dawn approached, Bartholomew decided it was time to return. He found his way back to his own street, and through the same gap in the window screen. He was tired but satisfied, his heart brimming with the memories of his adventure.\n\nBack in his familiar living room, Bartholomew curled up in his favorite spot, the sun warming his fur. He was still a house cat, but he was also a seasoned adventurer, his emerald eyes holding a newfound wisdom. And whenever the wind whispered through his window screen, he knew that the world beyond was calling, waiting for his next daring escapade. \n\n",

It's a powerful tool to enhance your Git workflow by displaying various information about your current repository right in your prompt.\n\nHere's why you might use it:\n\n* **Detailed Git information:** The prompt shows you the current branch, upstream status, staged changes, uncommitted changes, conflicts, and more. This gives you a quick overview of the repository state without needing separate commands.\n* **Customization:** The script offers a wide range of customization options, including:\n    * **Themes:** You can choose different color schemes to personalize your prompt's appearance.\n    * **Symbols:**  Define your own symbols for various prompt elements (e.g., ahead, behind, untracked).\n    * **Information to display:**  Control what information you want to see in the prompt (e.g., username and repo, upstream status).\n* **Virtual environment awareness:** The script integrates with popular virtual environment tools like virtualenv, Node.js, and Conda, displaying the active environment in the prompt.\n* **Prompt commands:** The script provides functions like `git_prompt_toggle` to easily disable/enable the Git prompt and `git_prompt_list_themes` to see available themes.\n\n**How to use it:**\n\n1. **Save the code:** Save the provided code as a `.sh` file (e.g., `git-prompt.sh`).\n2. **Add to your `.bashrc`:** In your shell's configuration file (usually `.bashrc`), add a line to source the script:\n   ```bash\n   source /path/to/your/git-prompt.sh\n   ```\n3. **Reload your shell:** Run `source ~/.bashrc` or close and reopen your terminal for the changes to take effect.\n\nOnce set up, you'll have a sophisticated Git prompt with information readily available. You can then customize it further by modifying variables and functions within the script. \n"
